    description: CodeFuse-MFTcoder is a multi-task fine-tuning framework designed to enhance the programming capabilities of large code models. Unlike traditional single-task fine-tuning, it can handle multiple programming tasks simultaneously, balancing the differences in data volume, difficulty, and convergence speed among various tasks by combining diverse loss functions. This approach increases fine-tuning efficiency and performance. Additionally, the framework incorporates efficient training optimization techniques, is compatible with several well-known open-source large models, and ranks first on the Opencompass Leaderboard for its MFT performance based on the Deepseek model.

    description: CodeFuse-MFT-VLM is a framework designed for multimodal large language models, aimed at compatibility and adaptation across various visual and linguistic models to support different types of tasks. It integrates a multitude of visual encoders such as the CLIP series, and language models like the Vicuna and LLAMA series, offering flexible configuration options. This allows users to freely combine different models using VL-MFTCoder, thereby simplifying the development and application process for multimodal tasks.

  description: ModelCache is a semantic cache for large language models (LLMs). By caching pre-generated model results, it reduces response time for similar requests and improves user experience.This project aims to optimize services by introducing a caching mechanism. It helps businesses and research institutions reduce the cost of inference deployment, improve model performance and efficiency, and provide scalable services for large models. Through open-source, we aim to share and exchange technologies related to large model semantic cache.

  title: Automated Testing
  description: TestAgent is the first open-source large model in the domestic testing industry, which includes the most powerful 7B large model for testing domains, as well as an accompanying framework for rapid local model deployment and an engineered experience. TestAgent is designed to build an "intelligence agent" within the testing field, integrating large models with engineering technologies in the quality domain to promote generational upgrades in quality technology. We look forward to collaborating with community members to create innovative solutions in the testing field, to construct a 24-hour online testing assistant service, making testing as smooth as silk.

PerformanceEvaluation:
  title: Performance Evaluation
  description: CodeFuseEval is an enterprise-level, multi-type programming task evaluation benchmark developed on top of the open-source HumanEval-x, MBPP, and DS1000 benchmarks, integrated with the multi-task scenarios of the CodeFuse large model. It is designed for assessing the capabilities of large models in various tasks such as code completion, natural language code generation, test case generation, cross-language code translation, Chinese instruction-based code generation, code annotation explanation, bug detection/fixing, and code optimization. CodeFuseEval is built to closely reflect real-world business scenarios, and aims to create a multidimensional, diverse, and trustworthy evaluation benchmark for measuring large models' code generation capabilities.
