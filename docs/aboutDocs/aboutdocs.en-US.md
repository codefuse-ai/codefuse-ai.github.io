## CodeFuse Team

The CodeFuse Team is a group of enthusiastic people that aims to build Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) to support and enhance AI-native software development throughout the full life cycle, covering crucial stages such as design requirements, coding, testing, building, deployment, operations, and insight analysis.We embrace open source and have released 15 code-related models, along with a series of open-sourced techniques, such as MFTCoder, CodeFuse-VLM, CodeFuse-DevOps, CodeFuse-Query, TestGPU, CodeFuse-muAgent.We also built CodeFuse-IDE plugins for users to benefit from the assistance of CodeFuse in their daily coding work. Feel free to chat with us, and you are welcome to join us for this amazing work!
