## Generation environmentÔºö

CodeFuse-13B: Python 3.8 or above,PyTorch 1.12 or above, with a recommendation for 2.0 or above, Transformers 4.24.0 or above ,CUDA 11.4 or above (for GPU users and flash-attention users, this option should be considered).

CodeFuse-CodeLlama-34B:python>=3.8,pytorch>=2.0.0,transformers==4.32.0,Sentencepiece,CUDA 11.

## Evaluation Environment

The evaluation of the generated codes involves compiling and running in multiple programming languages. The versions of the programming language environments and packages we use are as follows:

| Dependency | Version  |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Python     | 3.10.9   |
| JDK        | 18.0.2.1 |
| Node.js    | 16.14.0  |
| js-md5     | 0.7.3    |
| C++        | 11       |
| g++        | 7.5.0    |
| Boost      | 1.75.0   |
| OpenSSL    | 3.0.0    |
| go         | 1.18.4   |
| cargo      | 1.71.1   |

In order to save everyone the trouble of setting up the environments for these languages, we create a Docker image with the required environments and codefuseEval.

```bash
docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/codefuse/codefuseeval:latest
```

If you are familiar with docker, you can build the image from `codefuseEval/docker/Dockerfile` or configure the Dockerfile as you like it:

```bash
cd codefuseEval/docker
docker build [OPTIONS] .
```

After obtaining the image, you can build a container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --gpus all --mount type=bind,source=<LOCAL PATH>,target=<PATH IN CONTAINER> [OPTIONS] <IMAGE NAME:TAG>
```

## Check result CommandÔºö

We provide the script to check the result for provided code LLMs. Please use following scripts to check corresponding results and the environment .

```bash
bash codefuseEval/script/check_reference.sh codefuseEval/result/CodeFuse-CodeLlama-34B/humaneval_result_python.jsonl humaneval_python
bash codefuseEval/script/check_reference.sh codefuseEval/result/CodeFuse-13B/humaneval_result_python.jsonl humaneval_python
```

## How to use CodeFuseEval

1.  Download the model and update current model infomation in ckpt_config.json. Mainly update „Äåpath„Äçparameter in corresponding model and version.
2.  Run following generation comand to generate result.

```
bash codefuseEval/script/generation.sh MODELNAME MODELVERSION EVALDATASET OUTFILE

eg:
bash codefuseEval/script/generation.sh CodeFuse-13B v1 humaneval_python result/test.jsonl
```

3. Run following evaluation command to evaluate the generated result for corresponding model and version.

```
bash codefuseEval/script/evaluation.sh <RESULT_FILE> <METRIC> <PROBLEM_FILE>
eg:
bash codefuseEval/script/evaluation.sh codefuseEval/result/test.jsonl pass@k humaneval_python
```

## Evaluation

We recommend evaluating in [the provided image](#evaluation-environment). To evaluate the generated samples, save generated codes in the following JSON list format:

```
{"task_id": "../..", "generation: "..."}
{"task_id": "../..", "generation: "..."}
...
```

and evaluate them using the following script under the root directory of the repository (<font color='red'>please execute with caution, the generated codes might have unexpected behaviours though with very low possibility. See the warnings in [execution.py]() and uncomment the execution lines at your own risk</font>):

### Evaluation Data

Data are stored in `codefuseEval/data`, using JSON list format. We first integrated humaneval-X dataset.

- `task_id`: indicates the target language and ID of the problem. Language is one of ["Python", "Java", "JavaScript", "CPP", "Go"].
- `prompt`: the function declaration and docstring, used for code generation.
- `declaration`: only the function declaration, used for code translation.
- `canonical_solution`: human-crafted example solutions.
- `test`: hidden test samples, used for evaluation
- `example_test`: public test samples (appeared in prompt), used for evaluation.
- `prompt_text`: prompt text
- `prompt_explain`: prompt explanation
- `func_title`: code function title
- `prompt_text_chinese`: Chinese prompt

### Evaluation Metrics

In addition to the unbiased pass@k indicators currently provided in [Codex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374), we will also integrate the relevant indicators of huggingface open source with [CodeBLEU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10297) for integration.
The main indicators currently recommended for users are as follows:

- `codebleu`
- `pass@k`
- `bleu`
- `bleurt`

For other related metrics, you can check the code of the metric or the evaluation code to meet your requirements.

At the same time, we supplemented the indicators of the total and average generation time of the model for the dataset `total_time_cost` and `Average time cost`

Output during each generation, making it convenient for users to measure the generation performance of the model in the same environment. This indicator is passive output, and it will be output every time it is generated.

### Evaluation CommandÔºö

```
bash codefuseEval/script/evaluation.sh <RESULT_FILE> <METRIC> <PROBLEM_FILE> <TEST_GROUDTRUTH>
eg:
bash codefuseEval/script/evaluation.sh codefuseEval/result/test.jsonl pass@k humaneval_python
```

At the same time, we currently provide the following flags, which can directly bring the sample answers in the test data set as generated answers for testing.

- `TEST_GROUDTRUTH` default False

When TEST_GROUDTRUTH is True, the self-test mode is turned on, PROBLEM_FILE will be read, and the sample answer will be substituted as the generated answer for testing.

When TEST_GROUDTRUTH is False, open the evaluation mode, read RESULT_FILE and PROBLEM_FILE, and substitute the generated answer for testing.

## More Infomation

### Evaluation self model and dataset

1.  Registry your evaluate dataset.

- Download evaluation dataset to store in `codefuseEval/data` or other directory. Dataset must be jsonl.
- Setup information dataset `EVAL_DATASET`,`DATASET_SUPPORT` and `DATASET_LANGUAGE` in `codefuseEval/util.py` for dataset path, dataset task_mode and generation code language

2.  Registry your evaluate model.

- Download evaluation model to store in `codefuseEval/model` or other directory.
- Write your evaluation model processor code in `codefuseEval/processor` package.

We designed an infrastructure called Processor. Its main purpose is to handle the differences between different models. It mainly needs to complete three abstract functions:

- `load_model_tokenizer`:Due to differences in model loading parameters and tokenizer terminators, models need to use different parameters for adaptation and loading. The current function is mainly to help users load and adapt different models.
- `process_before`: Since prompt adapts to different prompt styles according to different types of evaluation tasks or different models selected by users, the „Äåprocess_before„Äçfunction is extracted mainly to help users process prompts.
- `process_after`:Due to the diversity of model generation results, in order to adapt to the evaluation framework, the generated result data can be spliced into appropriate use cases for automated operation. The current function mainly processes the generated results to adapt to the evaluation data set and results based on the task type and data set conditions.

You can extend the `BaseProcessor` in `codefuseEval/processor/base.py` and implement above functions

- Setup information model in `ckpt_config.json`. For Example as follow

```

  "CodeFuse-13B": {     //model name
    "v1": {             //model version

        "num_return_sequences": 1,
        "top_p": 0.9,
        "num_beams": 1,
        "do_sample": true
      },
      "batch_size": 1,            // batch size for generate
      "sample_num": 1,            // The number of samples generated by a single piece of data
