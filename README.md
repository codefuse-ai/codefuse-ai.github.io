## Further Updates

1. We will continue to improve the content of the documentation to provide better technical support.
2. A Blog page will be added to continuously synchronize the latest technology/technical applications/academic forefront articles of CodeFuse.
3. CodeFuse's online community activities, including newcomer task plan reference cases, community co-construction plan reference cases, etc., will also be synchronized here.

## About the CodeFuse Team

The CodeFuse team consists of a group of passionate members. Our goal is to build large-scale coding language models (Code LLMs) to support and enhance AI-native development work throughout the entire software development lifecycle. Our work covers key segments from design requirements, writing code, testing, building, deployment, operations to insight analysis. We actively promote the spirit of open source and have launched 15 code-related models and open-sourced a series of technical tools, such as MFTCoder, CodeFuse-VLM, CodeFuse-DevOps, CodeFuse-Query, TestGPT, and CodeFuse-muAgent. Moreover, to allow users to benefit directly in their daily coding work, we have also developed the CodeFuse-IDE plugin. Additionally, the CodeFuse team has had 6 technical papers accepted by top conferences, with technical stacks involving semantic retrieval, context enlargement, large model training fine-tuning, large model inference acceleration, and other large model technology fields. We have also participated in standards setting with the CICT and ITU, winning multiple domestic industry awards, and have been granted two software monographs. We warmly welcome communication, and if you are interested in this exciting work, please join us!
